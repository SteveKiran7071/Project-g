# Project-g

Project Goals:

• Develop and execute an experimental laboratory setup, method and analysis to quantitatively determine the local acceleration due to gravity at Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Provide appropriate analysis output to the user.

• Complete an uncertainty analysis of the measurements.

• Compare and quantitatively assess the percentage error between the measured value and an accepted value.

• Present all your work/efforts/creations/findings within a professional engineering report.
